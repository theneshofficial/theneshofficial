### Hello everyone 👋

#### A brief intro :P

- A Full Stack dev in love with the JavaScript ecosystem who enjoys understanding and implementing service in the Cloud.

- 🔭 I have experience with technologies like React, Node and with creating and deploying applications on AWS hands-on with various services like ECS, Lambda, RDS, S3 and Cloudfront to name a few.

- GraphQL and TypeScript have blown me away and the Developer Experience that they provide makes me never wanna go back to REST, PHP and JS 🤪

#### Hobbies ⚡

- I love playing piano 🎹 and to watch Netflix 📺.

- I like playing games 🎮 in my spare time so do send me suggestions of your favourite games 😄
